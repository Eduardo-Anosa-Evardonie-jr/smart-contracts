# smart-contracts

This is the repository for the Bread Token (BRD) Crowdsale and ERC20 smart contracts.

### Getting started

We use Truffle and OpenZeppelin for development. The main smart contracts (BRDToken and 
BRDCrowdsale) are based on OpenZeppelin's MintableToken and Crowdsale base contracts.

For development, we use ganache-cli using the default settings.

To test, start ganache-cli and run `truffle test`
